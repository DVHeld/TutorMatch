#PURPOSE
The TutorMatch module allows teachers to maintain a record of students' topic mastery, and implements the TutorMatch methodology.

TutorMatch is an experimental methodology based on Peer Instruction that tries to lower the difficulty of adopting an active learning methodology by automating part of the process, while also trying to improve on it by means of the use of topic mastery reporting on the part of the students to dynamically assign topics to them during the sessions.

Many variables can be configured, like group size, round duration and tutor assignment.
